# The Python Junkyard

This repo is a dumping ground/junkyard for my python code.

It contains:

- learning and tutorial code
- half baked, unfinished, or unpolished ideas
- quick tests
- miscellaneous scripts written to accomplish small tasks
- bits and pieces of python code with no better home
- zero warranty of even minimal quality
